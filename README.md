Open Sensor is mainly written in order to provide an open-source and safe way to access sensor data of the device. It has a source-sink model where the data is collected from the source sensors and are sent to the chosen sinks.

The main objective is to collect sensor data such as accelerometer or gyroscope and publish it to Home Assistant through MQTT.
